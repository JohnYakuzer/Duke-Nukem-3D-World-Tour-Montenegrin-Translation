# Duke-Nukem-3D-World-Tour-Montenegrin-Translation
---------------------------------------------------
Hi there, have you always wondered what would it feel to play duke nukem on montenegrin language?
Or you just came here by accident and wonder yourself what is happening. Anyway, I got bored one night and decided to translate Duke Nukem 3D World Tour to the greates language ever spoken Montenegrin (insert sleep emoji, becouse I am to lazy to do it myself). 

Anyway, this is free fan-translation that you can download and play with.
As of now I would say that I have managed to translate about 93% of the stings in the game. Which would mean that this project should be done soon.

#What is translated?
Well, pretty much everything, some elements of UI are not (such as game logo and UI, since they are seperate entities in the game files and require different method for editing), but multiplayer is also translated so cool I guess. That is if you manage to find friends to play this game with.

#Installation
1.Download the file
2.Go to the game location(for most perople that should be in their steam folder) and find folder called locale
3.Replace your default language strings.txt with montenegrin one.
4.Brt, igraj Vojvodu na CG i ćuti i uživaj.
